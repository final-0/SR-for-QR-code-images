# SR-for-QR-code-images
## Abstruct
  In this paper, we propose super resolution method
for converting unreadable low resolution QR code images into
readable high resolution images. We used Generative Adversarial
Networks(GAN) for super resolution. In general, super
resolution models using GAN such as SRGAN require a lot
of computational complexity and memory usage. As a result, it
is difficult for people to use without high performing GPUs. To
solve this issue, we propose QRGAN, a simple super resolution
model for QR code images. By targeting only QR code images for
super resolution tasks, we enabled to reduce both computational
complexity and memory usage.
